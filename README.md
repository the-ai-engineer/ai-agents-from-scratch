# Build AI Agents from First Principles

> *Learn to build autonomous AI agents from scratch using pure Python and the OpenAI API*

**Stop copying framework code. Start understanding how agents actually work.**

## üöÄ What Makes This Course Different?

Most AI courses teach you to use LangChain or LlamaIndex. You copy-paste code that works until it doesn't. When things break, you're stuck because **you never learned the fundamentals**.

This course is different:

‚úÖ **No frameworks** - Pure Python + OpenAI API (understand what's really happening)
‚úÖ **Industry-standard patterns** - Based on [Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) research
‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Real error handling, cost tracking, optimization strategies
‚úÖ **Visual learning** - Mermaid diagrams throughout every key concept
‚úÖ **Self-contained lessons** - Jump to any topic or follow sequentially

## üí° Why Learn from Scratch?

When you understand first principles, you can:
- Build with **any** framework (or create your own)
- Debug mysterious issues at 2am with confidence
- Make architecture decisions based on understanding, not guessing
- Never be blocked by incomplete documentation

Frameworks hide complexity. We embrace transparency.

## üß† The Core Insight

> **"Agents are models using tools in a loop."**

This memorable definition (from Anthropic research) captures everything:
- **Models**: LLMs provide reasoning and decision-making
- **Tools**: Functions that interact with the real world
- **Loop**: Continuous observe ‚Üí decide ‚Üí act ‚Üí update cycle

Everything else‚Äîmemory, planning, multi-agent systems‚Äîis refinement of this core pattern.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

### Foundations
- **OpenAI Responses API** (the modern way to call LLMs)
- **ConversationMemory** helper for managing context
- **Prompt engineering** techniques that actually work
- **Structured outputs** with Pydantic for type-safe responses

### The 5 Workflow Patterns (from Anthropic)
1. **Prompt Chaining** - Sequential pipelines with `WorkflowState`
2. **Routing** - Conditional branching to specialized handlers
3. **Parallelization** - Concurrent execution for speed
4. **Orchestrator-Workers** - Dynamic task decomposition
5. **Evaluator-Optimizer** - Generate-evaluate-refine loops

### Agent Architecture
- **Tool calling** - Give AI the ability to take actions
- **Agent loops** - Multi-step reasoning that decides what to do next
- **Memory management** - Conversation history and context
- **RAG systems** - Vector search with ChromaDB
- **Production deployment** - FastAPI with streaming

### When to Use What
- **Workflows vs Agents** - The critical architectural decision
- **WorkflowState vs ConversationMemory** - Managing different types of state

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- [UV package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- OpenAI API key
- Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes, type hints)

### Installation

This repository uses UV for fast, reliable dependency management. Each lesson is self-contained with its own isolated environment.

#### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

#### Set up your API key

```bash
# Create .env file in the root directory
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
```

### Usage

Each lesson is self-contained with:
- **README.md** - Tutorial and explanations
- **example.py** - Working code you can run
- **pyproject.toml** - Dependencies and project metadata
- **requirements.txt** - Legacy pip dependencies (for reference)

Start with lesson 01 and work your way through sequentially.

```bash
# Navigate to any lesson
cd 01-api-basics

# Install dependencies and run (UV creates isolated environment automatically)
uv run example.py

# Or install dependencies explicitly first
uv sync
uv run python example.py
```

Each lesson has its own isolated environment, so you can work through them independently without dependency conflicts.

## üí° Learning Path

### If you're brand new to AI:
Start at lesson 01 and work through each lesson in order.

### If you know the basics:
- Skip to lesson 05 for tool calling
- Jump to lesson 07 for workflow patterns
- Jump to lesson 09 for agent architecture
- Go to lesson 11 for complete examples

### If you want to see working agents:
Check out lessons 11 and 12 for complete, production-ready examples.

## üéì Key Concepts

### Workflows vs Agents: The Critical Distinction

**Workflows (Lesson 07):**
- **YOU** define the execution flow
- Deterministic paths (outline ‚Üí draft ‚Üí polish)
- Use `WorkflowState` dataclass for intermediate results
- Like assembly lines with fixed stations

**Agents (Lessons 08+):**
- **LLM** decides the execution flow dynamically
- Non-deterministic reasoning (agent chooses tools)
- Use `ConversationMemory` for conversational context
- Like consultants who decide their approach

üìä **[See visual comparison diagram ‚Üí](./07-workflow-patterns/README.md)**

### Production-Ready from Day 1
Every example includes:
- Error handling (rate limits, network failures)
- Type validation with Pydantic
- Token counting for cost tracking
- Performance optimization strategies
- Clear visual diagrams explaining flows

### When to Use What
