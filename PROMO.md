### Reddit Post (r/MachineLearning, r/learnprogramming)

**Title:** [D] I built a free course: "Build AI Agents from First Principles" (no frameworks, pure Python)

**Body:**

I've been building production agent systems for the past year, and I kept seeing the same problem: developers copying framework code without understanding how it works.

So I created a course that teaches you to build agents from scratch.

**What it covers:**

- OpenAI API fundamentals (using the new Responses API)
- The 5 workflow patterns from Anthropic's "Building Effective Agents"
- Tool calling and function execution
- Autonomous agent loops (the core of agent autonomy)
- Memory management and conversation context
- RAG with vector databases (ChromaDB)
- Production deployment with FastAPI

**Why "from scratch"?**

When you build something yourself, you understand:
- Why certain patterns exist
- What tradeoffs were made
- How to debug when things break
- When to use what approach

This makes you framework-agnostic. Use LangChain, LlamaIndex, or build your own‚Äîyou'll know what's happening under the hood.

**Course structure:**

13 self-contained lessons. Each has:
- Detailed README explaining concepts
- Complete working code
- Mermaid diagrams for visual learners
- Real-world use cases

Jump to any lesson or follow sequentially.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python proficiency
- Basic API knowledge
- OpenAI API key (~$2 for the entire course)

No ML/AI experience required.

**It's completely free** (MIT license). If you find it valuable, star the repo or contribute improvements.

Happy to answer questions in the comments!

5. "Why you should build agents from scratch (at least once)"

### Email Body

**Version 1: Problem-Focused**

Subject: Stop copy-pasting AI code‚Äîlearn how it actually works

Hey [Name],

Quick question: Have you ever copied LangChain code that worked perfectly... until it didn't?

Then you're stuck. The error message is cryptic. The documentation doesn't help. Stack Overflow has nothing. You're blocked.

**Here's why this happens:**

Most AI courses teach you to USE frameworks, not UNDERSTAND them. You're building on abstractions you don't comprehend.

**I just released a solution:**

"Build AI Agents from First Principles" - a free course that teaches you how agents actually work.

No frameworks. Pure Python. Just the patterns that power every production system.

You'll learn:

‚Üí The 5 workflow patterns from Anthropic's research
‚Üí How autonomous agent loops actually work
‚Üí When to use workflows vs agents (critical decision)
‚Üí Tool calling, memory management, and RAG systems
‚Üí Production deployment with FastAPI

13 self-contained lessons. Complete code examples. Mermaid diagrams throughout.

Total cost: ~$2 in OpenAI credits.

**Why learn from scratch?**

Once you understand fundamentals, every framework becomes easy. You can build with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or create your own. You're never blocked by documentation.

Plus, when you're debugging at 2am (and you will be), you'll actually know what's happening.

It's free and open source (MIT license).

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Even if you're already using frameworks, building one from scratch will level up your understanding dramatically.

## üìù Blog Post Intro

**Title:** "Why I Built a Course on AI Agents (And Why It Starts From Zero)"

**Intro:**

Six months ago, I was debugging a LangChain agent at 2am. The error was cryptic. The stack trace unhelpful. The documentation... well, let's just say it wasn't built for this use case.

I realized the problem: I didn't actually understand how agents worked.

I'd copied examples. Followed tutorials. Built prototypes that seemed to work. But when things broke‚Äîand in production, things always break‚ÄîI had no mental model to fall back on.

So I went back to basics. I rebuilt an agent from scratch using just the OpenAI API and Python. No frameworks. No abstractions. Just the core patterns.

Everything clicked.

I understood why agent loops exist. Why tool calling works the way it does. Why memory management matters. The "magic" disappeared, replaced by clear, debuggable logic.

That's why I built this course.

## üí¨ Community Engagement Responses

Pre-written responses for common questions:

**"Why not just use LangChain?"**
"Great question! LangChain is awesome for prototyping. But when you understand fundamentals first, you can use LangChain (or any framework) more effectively. Plus, you'll be able to debug issues and make architecture decisions with confidence."

**"Do I need ML experience?"**
"Nope! If you can code in Python and understand APIs, you can build agents. We start from absolute basics and build up progressively."

**"How long does it take?"**
"8-12 hours total. Each lesson is 30-60 minutes. You can complete it in a weekend or spread it out over a few weeks‚Äîwhatever works for you."

**"Is this production-ready code?"**
"The patterns are production-ready. For actual production, you'd add auth, monitoring, rate limiting, etc. We focus on the AI patterns, not DevOps infrastructure."
