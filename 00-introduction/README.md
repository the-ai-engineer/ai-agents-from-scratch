# AI Agents From First Principles

## Welcome & Course Overview

This is a comprehensive course that shows how to build AI agents and AI systems from scratch in pure Python.

Why learn from scratch?

When you understand first principles, you can:

- Build most AI systems without needing frameworks (just simple code)
- Build with **any** framework (or create your own)
- Build deeper understanding of how things actually work

Here's what the Anthropic team says on this topic:

> *"Frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts and responses, making them harder to debug. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code."*

## What You'll Gain

Right now, AI agents probably feel like black boxes. You've seen demos, maybe tried some frameworks, but you can't quite picture what's actually happening under the hood.

This course takes you from **confused to clear**.

You'll build AI agents from scratch using pure Python and the OpenAI API - no frameworks hiding the details. You'll see exactly what the LLM receives, how tools execute, and how responses flow back. No magic, no mystery.

By the end, you'll have:

- **Mental clarity** - You'll understand exactly how agents work, not just how to use them
- **Deep debugging ability** - When things break, you'll know why and how to fix them
- **Framework independence** - You'll recognize the patterns inside LangGraph and other tools, so you can use them intentionally (or build your own)
- **Confident decision-making** - You'll evaluate AI tools critically instead of following every new trend

## Our Approach: First Principles

We start with the fundamentals - direct LLM API calls and simple Python. You'll see exactly what's happening at each step: the prompts, the responses, the tool execution flow.

Then you'll build the core patterns yourself. Not because frameworks are bad, but because understanding the basics means you can:

- Debug faster - you see exactly what's happening
- Switch models or services without relearning abstractions
- Build exactly what you need without framework constraints
- Add frameworks later when they actually save you time, not because everyone else is using them

AI engineering is just software engineering with LLMs. We'll focus on proven patterns and timeless principles that work across any model or tool.

You move from confusion to mastery by understanding how things actually work - then you can choose your abstractions wisely.

## Course Structure

This course covers 10 lessons, progressing from fundamentals to autonomous agents:

```
Lessons 1-3: Fundamentals → Lessons 4-6: Building Blocks → Lessons 7-8: Workflows → Lessons 9-10: Autonomous Agents
```

**Foundations (Lessons 1-3)**

- How LLMs work and their capabilities
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Development environment setup

**Building Blocks (Lessons 4-6)**

- Making API calls and streaming responses
- Managing conversation memory
- Structured output with Pydantic

**Workflows & Tools (Lessons 7-8)**

- Giving AI the ability to call functions and APIs
- Five workflow patterns for orchestrating multiple LLM calls

**Autonomous Agents (Lessons 9-10)**

- Building the agent loop from scratch
- Creating reusable Agent classes
- Production memory management

Each lesson builds on the previous one, taking you from basic API calls to production-ready autonomous agents.
