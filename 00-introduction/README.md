# AI Agents From Scratch

Welcome to this course where we'll be building AI agents from first principles. 

Most AI courses teach you to use LangGraph or other frameworks. You copy-paste code that works until it doesn't. When things break, you're stuck because you never learned the fundamentals.

**This course is different.**

You'll build AI agents from scratch using pure Python and the OpenAI API. No magic. No black boxes. Just the patterns that power every production agent system.

By the end, you'll understand **exactly** how agents work - and you'll be able to build them in any framework or create your own.
