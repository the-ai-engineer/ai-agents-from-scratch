# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a tutorial repository teaching AI agent development from scratch using Python and the OpenAI API. The focus is on fundamentals without frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex. Each lesson is self-contained with a README.md explaining concepts and an example.py demonstrating the implementation.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a progressive learning path with 13 lessons organized by complexity:

**Foundations (01-03):** Basic OpenAI API usage, prompting techniques, and structured output with Pydantic
**Tool Calling (04-05):** Implementing function calling, both basic and with Pydantic validation
**Workflow Patterns (06):** Orchestrating multiple LLM calls with five fundamental patterns (chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer)
**Agent Architecture (07-09):** Building agent loops, creating reusable Agent classes, and managing conversation memory
**Complete Examples (10-11):** Production-ready agents including FAQ bot with RAG (ChromaDB) and research assistant
**Advanced (12-13):** ReAct pattern for planning/reasoning and FastAPI deployment

**Workflow Patterns (06-workflow-patterns):** Five fundamental patterns for orchestrating multiple LLM calls:
- **Prompt Chaining:** Sequential workflows where each step feeds into the next (e.g., outline ‚Üí draft ‚Üí polish). Uses `WorkflowState` dataclass to track intermediate results.
- **Routing:** Conditional branching to specialized prompts based on classification (e.g., customer support triage)
- **Parallelization:** Concurrent LLM calls using async/await for speed (e.g., bulk processing, multi-perspective analysis)
- **Orchestrator-Workers:** Central LLM dynamically decomposes tasks and delegates to worker LLMs in parallel, then synthesizes results (e.g., research assistant breaking down topics)
- **Evaluator-Optimizer:** Generate-evaluate-refine loops for quality control (e.g., code generation ‚Üí review ‚Üí improvement)

**Agent Class Pattern (08-agent-class/example.py):** The core reusable abstraction used across lessons 8-13. Key features:
- `register_tool()`: Add tools with Pydantic schemas for validation
- `chat()`: Main interface handling the agent loop internally
- `conversation_history`: List of message dicts maintaining context
- `max_iterations`: Prevents infinite loops in multi-step reasoning
- Tool execution with automatic error handling

**Tool Calling Flow:** User message ‚Üí LLM decides tools to call ‚Üí Execute tools ‚Üí Add results to history ‚Üí LLM synthesizes final answer. This loop continues until LLM returns a final answer (no tool_calls) or max_iterations reached.

**RAG Pattern (10-example-faq-agent):** Uses ChromaDB for vector storage with OpenAI embeddings. Knowledge base is populated at startup, then queries use semantic search to retrieve relevant context before answering.

**FastAPI Deployment (13-fastapi-deployment):** Stateful conversation management with in-memory sessions (production should use Redis/database). Supports both standard and streaming responses.

## Development Commands

All lessons share a single root pyproject.toml for simplicity.

```bash
# Install UV (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # macOS/Linux
# or: pip install uv

# Set up environment (once, in root directory)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
uv sync

# Run any lesson from anywhere
uv run 01-api-basics/example.py
cd 05-tool-calling-pydantic
uv run example.py

# Run FastAPI server (lesson 13)
cd 13-fastapi-deployment
uv run uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000

# Optional: Install dev tools
uv add --dev pytest black ruff
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Single dependency installation for all lessons
- Fast, reliable dependency resolution with UV
- Jump to any lesson and run immediately
- No version drift between lessons
- Modern Python packaging best practices

## Important Conventions

- All examples use `gpt-4o-mini` by default for cost efficiency
- Tools must have Pydantic schemas for OpenAI function calling
- **State Management:**
  - Workflows use `WorkflowState` dataclasses to track intermediate results (e.g., `state.outline`, `state.draft`)
  - Agents use `ConversationMemory` class to maintain conversational context
  - Key distinction: WorkflowState = data flow, ConversationMemory = dialogue history
- Agent classes maintain conversation_history as a list of role/content dicts
- System prompts are optional but included in conversation_history when provided
- Tool results are added with role="tool" and tool_call_id for correlation
- Examples use eval() for simplicity but production code should use json.loads()
- Workflow patterns (lesson 06) use AsyncOpenAI for parallel execution with asyncio.gather()
- **Key distinction: Workflows (lesson 06) have predefined flows (YOU decide); Agents (lessons 07+) decide flows dynamically (LLM decides)**

## Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip
- OPENAI_API_KEY in .env file (in root directory)
- Single shared pyproject.toml for all lessons
- Virtual environment (.venv/) and uv.lock are git-ignored
