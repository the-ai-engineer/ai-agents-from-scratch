# Build AI Agents from First Principles

**Master the fundamentals. Skip the frameworks. Build production-ready agents.**

> *"The best way to understand AI agents is to build them yourself‚Äîwithout abstractions hiding how they actually work."*

## Why This Course?

Most AI courses teach you to use LangChain or LlamaIndex. You copy-paste code that works until it doesn't. When things break, you're stuck because you never learned the fundamentals.

**This course is different.**

You'll build autonomous AI agents from scratch using pure Python and the OpenAI API. No magic. No black boxes. Just the patterns that power every production agent system.

By the end, you'll understand **exactly** how agents work‚Äîand you'll be able to build them in any framework or create your own.

---

## What You'll Build

- **Intelligent Workflows** that orchestrate multiple LLM calls
- **Tool-Calling Agents** that interact with APIs and databases
- **Autonomous Agent Loops** that reason through multi-step problems
- **RAG Systems** with vector databases for knowledge retrieval
- **Production Agents** with FastAPI deployment and streaming responses

All using **first principles**‚Äîno frameworks, no shortcuts, no hidden complexity.

## Course Philosophy

### üéØ First Principles
Every pattern is explained from the ground up. No magic, no "just trust us." You'll see exactly how each piece fits together.

### üî¨ Production-Ready
This isn't academic theory. Every example uses patterns from real production systems. Error handling, cost tracking, and performance optimization included.

### üöÄ Modern Stack
- **UV package manager** for fast dependency management
- **OpenAI Responses API** (released March 2025)
- **Pydantic v2** for data validation
- **Python 3.10+** with modern syntax
- **Mermaid diagrams** for visual learning

### üìö Self-Contained Lessons
Each lesson stands alone with its own README and complete example code. Jump to any topic or follow sequentially‚Äîyour choice.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents-from-scratch

# Install dependencies (once)
cd ai-agents-from-scratch
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
uv sync

# Run any lesson
uv run 01-api-basics/example.py
uv run 06-workflow-patterns/example.py
uv run 10-example-faq-agent/example.py
```

That's it. No complex setup, no docker containers, no environment hell.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need ML/AI experience?**
A: No. We start from the absolute basics. If you can code in Python, you can build agents.

**Q: Why not just use LangChain?**
A: Frameworks are great for prototyping, but understanding fundamentals makes you a better engineer. Build from scratch first, then choose frameworks wisely.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: 8-12 hours to complete all lessons. Each lesson is 30-60 minutes of focused learning.

**Q: Is the code production-ready?**
A: The patterns are production-ready. For production deployment, you'd add authentication, monitoring, rate limiting, etc. We focus on the AI patterns, not DevOps.

**Q: What's the difference between workflows and agents?**
A: Workflows have predefined flows (you decide the steps). Agents decide their own flows dynamically (LLM chooses). Lesson 06 explains this in depth with visual diagrams.

**Q: Do you cover vector databases?**
A: Yes! Lesson 10 covers ChromaDB with OpenAI embeddings for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

**Q: What about Claude/Gemini/other models?**
A: We use OpenAI for teaching, but the patterns work with any LLM. Swap the client and you're done.
